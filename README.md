learning how to use git
I just got an opportunity to do something I am passionate about, to do something I love to do, to do something that with time, effort, intelligence and dedication I could possibly succeed in. I owe this all to you God...you where there for me and pulled me through, i'm not there yet, i'm not in the building, they could easily pull me out as easy as they pulled me in. But Lord, I want to prove to them I am capable, I want to be a living testement that blessings indeed come from you Lord. Amen!
